## Try it now

Try the GPT-4 powered PR-Action instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@KhulnaSoft` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The agent will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:
```
@KhulnaSoft /review
```
and the agent will respond with a review of your PR


To set up your own PR-Action, see the [Installation](https://khulnasoft.github.io/pr-action/installation/) section below.
Note that when you set your own PR-Action or use KhulnaSoft hosted PR-Action, there is no need to mention `@KhulnaSoft ...`. Instead, directly start with the command, e.g., `/ask ...`.

2. **Improved privacy** - No data will be stored or used to train models. PR-Action Pro will employ zero data retention, and will use an OpenAI account with zero data retention.
3. **Improved support** - PR-Action Pro users will receive priority support, and will be able to request new features and capabilities.
4. **Extra features** -In addition to the benefits listed above, PR-Action Pro will emphasize more customization, and the usage of static code analysis, in addition to LLM logic, to improve results. 
See [here](https://khulnasoft.github.io/pr-action/#pr-action-pro) for a list of features available in PR-Action Pro.



## How it works

The following diagram illustrates PR-Action tools and their flow:

![PR-Action Tools](https://khulnasoft.com/images/pr_action/diagram-v0.9.png)

Check out the [PR Compression strategy](https://khulnasoft.github.io/pr-action/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) page for more details on how we convert a code diff to a manageable LLM prompt

## Why use PR-Action?

A reasonable question that can be asked is: `"Why use PR-Action? What makes it stand out from existing tools?"`

Here are some advantages of PR-Action:

- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single GPT-4 call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.
- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://khulnasoft.github.io/pr-action/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.
- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the '/review' tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_action/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.
- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Action, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama2).


## Data privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Action

- If you host PR-Action with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

### KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Action Pro 💎

- When using PR-Action Pro 💎, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Action Pro will use KhulnaSoft’s proprietary models — if this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests’ data — PR-Action will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

### PR-Action Chrome extension

- The [PR-Action Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-action-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Action tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Action.
